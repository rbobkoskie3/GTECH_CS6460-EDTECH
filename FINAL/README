This project was both a research and development. The research utilized an application as an
independent variable for quantitative research into providing assistive technologies to allow the
visually impaired better access to digital media. The development consisted of a client-side
dynamic web page hosted on GitHub. The application explored high contrast setting and
sonification, which provides a second sensory modality (sound) to visualize objects that are
visual in nature. Feel free to explore the survey, application, source code and paper using the
links below. As of this writing, tokens from past projects can be applied to the current class
participation, so for those that have not already participated, you will find two token in the
application, and two tokens for taking the survey.
